/* This program is an encoder/decoder for Reed-Solomon codes. Encoding is in
   systematic form, decoding via the Berlekamp iterative algorithm.
   In the present form , the constants mm, nn, tt, and kk=nn-2tt must be
   specified  (the double letters are used simply to avoid clashes with
   other n,k,t used in other programs into which this was incorporated!)
   Also, the irreducible polynomial used to generate GF(2**mm) must also 

   The code is not written in the most elegant way, but to the best
   of my knowledge, (no absolute guarantees!), it works.
   However, when including it into a simulation program, you may want to do
   some conversion of global variables (used here because I am lazy!) to
   local variables where appropriate, and passing parameters (eg array
   addresses) to the functions  may be a sensible move to reduce the number
   of global variables and thus decrease the chance of a bug being introduced.
